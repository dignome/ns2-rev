Just a PoC vibe-coded NS2 (Natural Selection 2 - the game) netcode dumper.  So far it can re-assemble message fragments and can dump the voice portion of the type 5 (voice/state snapshot) message.

See notes for more information.

Also useful is the udpreplaygo repo - can use it to replay a game from client connect to map change (if it dosn't crash).
