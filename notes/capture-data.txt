Start wireshark and capture on your primary internet interface.

Play the game.
  
When done select the server IP address from the list of captured traffic, right click, and select Prepare as filter -> Selected.

Paste it and simply modify the filter rule:

ip.src == the.server.ip.address || ip.dst == the.server.ip.address

Apply and then save the capture.
